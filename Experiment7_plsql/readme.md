
# Experiment 7: PL/SQL – Variables, Control Structures and Loops

## AIM
To write and execute simple PL/SQL programs using variables, loops, and conditional statements.


## THEORY

PL/SQL, which stands for Procedural Language extensions to the Structured Query Language (SQL). It is a combination of SQL along with the procedural features of programming languages.

**Syntax:**
```sql
DECLARE 
   <declarations section> 
BEGIN 
   <executable command(s)>
EXCEPTION 
   <exception handling> 
END;
```

### Basic Components of PL/SQL Block:
- DECLARE: Section to declare variables and constants.
- BEGIN: The execution section that contains PL/SQL statements.
- EXCEPTION: Handles errors or exceptions that occur in the program.
- END: Marks the end of the PL/SQL block.

# PL/SQL Programs – Steps and Expected Output

## 1. Write a PL/SQL program to find the Greatest of Two Numbers

### Steps:
- Declare two numeric variables and initialize them.
- Use an `IF` statement to compare the values.
- Display the greater number using `DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE`.

**Expected Output:**  
Greater number is: 80
### Program:
```
DECLARE
    num1 NUMBER := 80;  -- First number
    num2 NUMBER := 50;  -- Second number
BEGIN
    IF num1 > num2 THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Greater number is: ' || num1);
    ELSE
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Greater number is: ' || num2);
    END IF;
END;
```
### Output:
